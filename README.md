# pragati_programming_judge
This project was created when I was in College. This was used to automate the C programming contest. Anyone who needs to use this for their college C programming contest can Use this.

# What is in a name ? (Pragati)
"Pragati" is the name of the Techfest of our Engineering College. ( A Private Engineering College in West Bengal, India) . It means PROGRESS

# How It Works
This is based on IO redirection. Pragati I-Judge has custom test cases in the DB ( MySQL in this scenario ), Also it has correct outputs for these custom test cases. The user submits his executable file. That is run against the test cases. The output produced is then verified against the correct output provided in the DB, based on which the scoring is done.
